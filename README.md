# baylissBoids

baylissBoids is a processing sketch simulating the flocking behaviours of birds.

The shapes and colours are inspired by a series of work entitled 'Swarms' by designer & artist Gareth Bayliss. The series were themselves inspired by the movements of flocking birds.

The sketch uses and builds upon the three steering behaviours of the 'Boids' artificial life program - separation, alignment and cohesion - first developed by Craig Reynolds in the 80's.

To run the sketchm open baylissBoids.pde found in sketch>baylissBoids using the Processing IDE.
